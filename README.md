**Hey, I'm Saleh!**
---
I'm a computer science student headed to UIUC in Champaign, IL for my master's. I specialized in backend with a strong interest in quantitative development using C++ and Python. I've worked across the board from backend infrastructure to implementing performance sensitive data logic. I'm deeply product driven and focused on delivering quality, high performance software.
