I'm a computer science student headed to UIUC in Champaign, IL for my master's. I specialized in backend with a strong interest in quantitative development, I've worked across the board from backend infrastructure to implementing performance sensitive data logic. I'm deeply product driven and focused on delivering quality, high performance software.
