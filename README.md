I'm a computer science student finishing up undergraduate headed to UIUC in Champagne, IL for a masters. I specialized in backend with a strong interest in quantitative development, I've worked across the board from backend infrastructure to implementing performance sensitive data logic. I'm deeply product driven and focused on delivering building quality, high performance software.
